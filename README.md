# Developer Portfolio - John Kim

The idea of this web portfolio is to showcase my work as a developer, provide a brief introduction of myself, as well as providing contact information for potential employers. To accomplish this, I applied best practices when developing this portfolio. 

Best practices include: 
* Semantic HTML Tags for search engine optimization and accessibility
* Consolidation and documentation of CSS Style sheet 
* Responsive Site Layout
